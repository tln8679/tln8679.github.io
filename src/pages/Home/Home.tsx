              I've been passionate about programming since the MySpace days, where
              I first started experimenting with code. I earned my BSc in Computer
              Science from UNCW 🎓, and for nearly 7 years, I’ve worked as a
              full-stack developer at a large corporation.
              <br />
              <br />
              Outside of tech, I live with my fiancée 💍, two cats 🐱🐱, and a dog 🐶.
              I enjoy playing pickleball 🏓, lifting weights 🏋️, and spending
              time outdoors 🌲.
