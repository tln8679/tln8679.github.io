          I've been passionate about programming since the MySpace days, where I first started experimenting with code. I earned my BSc in Computer Science from UNCW, and for nearly 7 years, Iâ€™ve worked as a full-stack developer at a large corporation.
          <br /><br />
          Outside of tech, I live with my partner, two cats, and a dog. I enjoy playing pickleball, lifting weights, and spending time outdoors.
